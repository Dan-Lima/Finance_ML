# Finance & Machine Learning Application
The purpose of this project is to create an application with 2 modules:
1) Basic option structure pricer: will use the Black & Scholes formula to price 5-leg structures
2) Machine learning: module that will apply machine learning algorithms for regression and classification problems with user-provided data

The goal here is not performance optimisation, but to use common python libraries (pandas, numpy, tkinter, etc). With that, the algorithms will be manually implemented, instead of using TensorFlow/Keras and other frameworks.

**Dependencies:**
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- xlrd

**To install these on Windows go to Command Prompt and use:**
<br>pip install "name of the package"

Example:
<br>pip install pandas

# How to run
You should run the home.py file:
<br>python home.py
