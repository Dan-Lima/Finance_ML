# Finance & Machine Learning Dashboard
The purpose of this project is to create a simple application with 2 modules:
1) Basic option structure pricer: will use basically the Black & Scholes formula to price basic 5-leg structures
2) Machine learning: module that will apply basic machine learning algorithms for regression and classification problems with user-provided data

The goal here is not optimisation, but to use the basic python libraries (pandas, numpy, tkinter, etc), so I will implement the algorithms manually instead of using TensorFlow/Keras, etc.

**Dependencies:**
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- xlrd

**To install these on Windows go to Command Prompt and use:**
<br>pip install "name of the package"

Example:
<br>pip install pandas
